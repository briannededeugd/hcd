# Human Centered Design

Welcome to my repository for the course Human Centered Design during the minor Web Design & Development, academic year 23-24. This course is about the end users that will be using our applications and websites, their needs as well as their struggles. 

As a student learning to program websites, I'm used to learning about the creative and practical aspects of web development. Make a site look good and make sure it works - a sentiment that I have been taught to adopt in my process. But there's an entire group in society has to be considered, a group that is alienalized on the internet, the very place that's growing in importance and increasing in importance for the ability to function in daily life.

This course is meant to put this group on the foreground, rather than keeping them as an afterthought, and we do that by literally taking them to the foreground of our process.

The class got divided into groups of three, each group assigned to a different end user. One end user was blind and required an application that allowed her to find an outfit, another end user was deaf and required appropriate and engaging closed captions, and another end user had limited motor skills and needed to be able to copy, paste and scroll with her pen and a digital tablet (Wacom).

The latter, a woman named Nicolette, was the end user of the group I belonged to, which meant that it was up to me to build her a copy-, paste- and scrollfunction. I decided to do so in the form of a 'reader', in which I provided Nicolette with a section of the story 'Ash Maiden' (the original story of Cinderella by the brothers Grimm). Nicolette would be able to copy the text, paste it elsewhere, and scroll the page without any hassle!

### First prototype test | April 11th 2024

*The prototype*

In preparation for the first test, I built a simple site that had a few functions. For one: I added the function that allowed Nicolette to make a selection with two clicks that would define a starting point and an end point. In my first considerations, I presumed that it would be more intuitive to make a selection by point than by word so that Nicolette's selection could be more detailed. For example: 

Clicking after the first 'q' in the sentence "_I guessed the query correctly_" and then after the 'y' of 'correctly would return "_eury correctly_".

Additionally, I added the function that allowed Nicolette to copy her selection by pressing 'C' on her keyboard and paste it by pressing 'P' on her keyboard. During the introduction, Nicolette shared that having to press two keys simultaneously in order to copy and paste made this action impossible for her, so I figured that reducing the number of keys requiring a keypress to one would make this easier for her.

*The test*

During the testing, I connected Nicolette's Wacom tablet to my laptop and asked her to move the mouse, which she did. The connection was succesful: so far, so good!

However, once I gave her the first assignment, it became clear to me how difficult it would be for her to be so precise in selection a specific start- and endpoint in the text. She brought the cursor over to the first word and I watched her hover, hesitating over the 'T', the 'h' and then the 'e' that formed the introduction to the text. At once, she made her click, but it diverged from the point she meant to and selected only the 'h' and the 'e'. There was a sheepish look on her face as she turned to me and said, "Yes, this won't work for me."

I nodded my head. "Okay," I said resolutely. "Would it be easier if I allowed you to select words instead of individual letters?" She confirmed that it would, and I made a mental note of this.

To then still test my next functionality, the copying and the pasting, I made a selection for her and gave her my next instruction. "You can copy this selection by pressing 'C' on your keyboard, and paste it by pressing 'P'."

Again, Nicolette shook her head. "My hands won't allow me. Anything with keyboards is too hard for me."

In this moment, I'd realized that I misunderstood her. Instead of not being able to press two keys simultaneously, Nicolette's hands didn't let her press keys at all. Which, yes, in hindsights was completely understandable, as she navigates with her pen and it would be too complicated to have to switch all the time, even if pressing the keys wasn't an issue. During this test, my curiosity to how Nicolette typed when the keys made it so difficult for her was satisfied with a simple answer: she uses a text-to-speech software.

*Lessons learned*

This test confronted me with the misconceptions I'd had about Nicolette's abilities and the extent of them. In retrospect, how exactly would one key be better than two, and how would a person with limited motor skills be able to perfectly line up their cursor with a small, almost pixel-sized point on a big screen? This test allowed me to come up with a few lessons learned, and a few ideas as to how to implement them:

1. Nicolette needs a bigger window for clicking (which aids in her selection process), can be implemented by
	- Selecting by word instead of point
2. Nicolette needs feedback on what she was about to select. When the second word was clicked, that's when the selection showed on the screen, but she is left in the dark until then, which needs to change. Can be implemented by
	- Making it clearer where she's hovering / what she's selecting before the selection has an end point
3. Nicolette needs to be able to copy and paste without the keyboard, can be implemented by
	- Using elements she can click with her mouse, like buttons

Something I also heard was that she struggled with scrolling. My 'application' fit in one viewport, so I decided to focus on the aforementioned points this week.
