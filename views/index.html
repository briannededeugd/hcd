						<p>
							The wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she felt that her end was
							drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and
							said, “Dear Child, be good and pious, and then the dear God will
							always protect you, and I will look down on you from Heaven and be
							near you.” Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed.
						</p>

						<p>
							Every day, the maiden went out to her mother’s grave and wept, and
							she remained pious and good. When winter came the snow spread a
							white sheet over the grave, and when the spring-sun had drawn it
							off again, the man had taken another wife.
						</p>

						<p>
							The woman had brought two daughters into the house with her, who
							were beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart. Now
							began a bad time for the poor child. “Is the stupid goose to sit
							in the parlor with us?” said they. “He who wants to eat bread,
							must earn it. Out with the kitchen-wench!”
						</p>

						<p>
							They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old gray
							bedgown on her and gave her wooden shoes. “Just look at the proud
							Princess, how decked out she is!” they cried, and laughed, and led
							her into the kitchen.
						</p>

						<p>
							There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up
							before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash. Besides
							this, the sisters did her every imaginable injury—they mocked her
							and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was
							forced to sit and pick them out again.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-2" class="page">
						<p>
							In the evening, when she had worked till she was weary, she had no
							bed to go to, but had to sleep by the fireside in the ashes. And
							as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called
							her Ash-Maiden.
						</p>

						<p>
							It happened once that the father was going to the Fair, and he
							asked the two daughters what he should bring back for them.
						</p>

						<p>
							“Beautiful dresses,” said one. “Pearls and jewels,” said the
							second.
						</p>

						<p>“And you, Ash-Maiden,” said he, “what will you have?”</p>

						<p>
							“Father, break off for me the first branch which knocks against
							your hat on your way home.”
						</p>

						<p>
							So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for the two
							daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green
							thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat.
							Then he broke off the branch and took it with him.
						</p>

						<p>
							When he reached home he gave the two daughters the things which
							they had wished for, and to Ash-Maiden he gave the branch from the
							hazel-bush. Ash-Maiden thanked him, went to her mother’s grave and
							planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell
							down on it and watered it.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-3" class="page">
						<p>
							It grew, however, and became a handsome tree. Thrice a day
							Ash-Maiden went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a
							little White Bird always came on the tree. And if Ash-Maiden
							expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her what she had wished
							for.
						</p>

						<p>
							It happened that the King gave a feast, which was to last three
							days. To it all the beautiful young girls in the country were
							invited, in order that his son might choose himself a Bride. When
							the two sisters heard that they too were to appear among the
							number, they were delighted.
						</p>

						<p>
							They called Ash-Maiden and said, “Comb our hair, brush our shoes,
							and fasten our buckles, for we are going to the feast at the
							King’s palace.”
						</p>

						<p>
							Ash-Maiden obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to
							go with them to the dance, and she begged her mother to allow her
							to do so.
						</p>

						<p>
							“You go, Ash-Maiden!” said she; “you are dusty and dirty, and
							would go to the feast? You have no clothes and shoes, and yet
							would dance!”
						</p>

						<p>
							As, however, Ash-Maiden went on asking, the mother at last said,
							“I have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you. If you
							have picked them out again in two hours, you shall go with us.”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-4" class="page">
						<p>
							The maiden went through the back-door into the garden, and called,
							“You tame Pigeons, you Turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the
							sky, come and help me to pick
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								“The good into the pot,<br />
								The bad into the crop!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and
							afterward the turtledoves. And at last all the birds beneath the
							sky came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes.
							And the pigeons nodded with their heads and began pick, pick,
							pick, pick, and the rest began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and
							gathered all the good grains into the dish. Hardly had one hour
							passed before they had finished, and all flew out again.
						</p>

						<p>
							Then the girl took the dish to the mother, and was glad, and
							believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the
							feast.
						</p>

						<p>
							But the mother said, “No, Ash-Maiden, you have no clothes and you
							cannot dance. You would only be laughed at.”
						</p>

						<p>
							And as Ash-Maiden wept at this, the mother said, “If you can pick
							two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you
							shall go with us.” And she thought to herself, “That she most
							certainly cannot do.”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-5" class="page">
						<p>
							When the mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the
							ashes, the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and
							cried, “You tame Pigeons, you Turtledoves, and all you birds under
							heaven, come and help me to pick
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								"The good into the pot,<br />
								The bad into the crop!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and
							afterward the turtledoves. And at last all the birds beneath the
							sky came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes.
							And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick,
							pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and
							gathered all the good seeds into the dishes. And before half an
							hour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again.
						</p>

						<p>
							Then the maiden carried the dishes to the mother and was
							delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the
							feast.
						</p>

						<p>
							But the mother said, “All this will not help you. You go not with
							us, for you have no clothes and cannot dance. We should be ashamed
							of you!”
						</p>

						<p>
							Then she turned her back on Ash-Maiden, and hurried away with her
							two proud daughters.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-6" class="page">
						<p>
							As no one was now at home, Ash-Maiden went to her mother’s grave
							beneath the hazel-tree, and cried:
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								“Shiver and quiver, Little Tree,<br />
								Silver and gold throw over me!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and
							slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She put on the dress
							with all speed, and went to the feast.
						</p>

						<p>
							Her sisters and the mother, however, did not know her, and thought
							she must be a foreign Princess, for she looked so beautiful in the
							golden dress. They never once thought of Ash-Maiden, and believed
							that she was sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of
							the ashes.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Prince went to meet her, took her by the hand, and he danced
							with her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never let go of
							her hand. And if any one else came to invite her, he said, “This
							is my partner.”
						</p>

						<p>
							She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home.
							But the King’s Son said, “I will go with you and bear you
							company,” for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden
							belonged.
						</p>

						<p>
							She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon-house.
							The King’s Son waited until her father came, and then he told him
							that the stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-7" class="page">
						<p>
							The old man thought, “Can it be Ash-Maiden?” and they had to bring
							him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to
							pieces, but no one was inside it.
						</p>

						<p>
							And when they got home, Ash-Maiden lay in her dirty clothes among
							the ashes, and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the
							mantelpiece. For Ash-Maiden had jumped quickly down from the back
							of the pigeon-house, and had run to the little hazel-tree. There
							she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the
							grave, and the bird had taken them away again. Then she had placed
							herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes, in her gray gown.
						</p>

						<p>
							Next day, when the feast began afresh, and her parents and the
							sisters had gone once more, Ash-Maiden went to the hazel-tree, and
							said:
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								“Shiver and quiver, Little Tree,<br />
								Silver and gold throw over me!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the
							preceding day. And when Ash-Maiden appeared at the feast in this
							dress, every one was astonished at her beauty.
						</p>

						<p>
							The King’s Son had waited until she came, and instantly took her
							by the hand and danced with no one but her. When others came and
							invited her, he said, “She is my partner.”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-8" class="page">
						<p>
							When evening arrived, she wished to leave, and the King’s Son
							followed her, and wanted to see into which house she went. But she
							sprang away from him, and into the garden behind the house.
							Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most
							magnificent pears. She clambered, like a squirrel, so nimbly
							between the branches, that the King’s Son did not know where she
							was gone.
						</p>

						<p>
							He waited until her father came, and said to him, “The
							stranger-maiden has escaped from me, and I believe she has climbed
							up the pear-tree.”
						</p>

						<p>
							The father thought, “Can it be Ash-Maiden?” and had an axe brought
							and cut the tree down, but no one was on it.
						</p>

						<p>
							And when they got into the kitchen, Ash-Maiden lay there amongst
							the ashes, as usual, for she had jumped down on the other side of
							the tree, had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little
							hazel-tree, and had put on her gray gown.
						</p>

						<p>
							On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away,
							Ash-Maiden went once more to her mother’s grave, and said to the
							little tree:
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								“Shiver and quiver, Little Tree,<br />
								Silver and gold throw over me!”
							</em>
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-9" class="page">
						<p>
							And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid
							and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were
							golden.
						</p>

						<p>
							And when she went to the feast in the dress, no one knew how to
							speak for astonishment. The King’s Son danced with her only, and
							if any one invited her to dance, he said, “She is my partner.”
						</p>

						<p>
							When evening came, Ash-Maiden wished to leave, and the King’s Son
							was anxious to go with her; but she escaped from him so quickly
							that he could not follow her. The King’s Son, however, had caused
							the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she
							ran down, had the maiden’s left slipper remained sticking. The
							King’s Son picked it up, and it was small and dainty, and all
							golden.
						</p>

						<p>
							Next morning, he went with it to the father, and said to him, “No
							one shall be my wife, but she whose foot this golden slipper
							fits.”
						</p>

						<p>
							Then were the two sisters glad, for they had pretty feet. The
							eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on,
							and her mother stood by. But she could not get her big toe into
							it, for the shoe was too small for her.
						</p>

						<p>
							Then her mother gave her a knife, and said, “Cut the toe off. When
							you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot.”
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-10" class="page">
						<p>
							The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe,
							swallowed the pain, and went out to the King’s Son. Then he took
							her on his horse as his Bride, and rode away with her. They were,
							however, obliged to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree,
							sat the two pigeons and cried:
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								“Turn and peep, turn and peep, <br />
								There’s blood within the shoe! The shoe<br />
								it is too small for her, <br />
								The true Bride waits for you!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Then he looked at her foot, and saw how the blood was streaming
							from it. He turned his horse round and took the false Bride home
							again, and said she was not the true one, and that the other
							sister was to put the shoe on.
						</p>

						<p>
							Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into
							the shoe, but her heel was too large.
						</p>

						<p>
							So her mother gave her a knife, and said, “Cut a bit off your
							heel. When you are Queen you will have no more need to go on
							foot.”
						</p>

						<p>
							The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe,
							swallowed the pain, and went out to the King’s Son. He took her on
							his horse as his Bride, and rode away with her. But when they
							passed by the hazel-tree, two little pigeons sat on it, and cried:
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-11" class="page">
						<p>
							<em>
								“Turn and peep, turn and peep, <br />
								There’s blood within the shoe! The shoe<br />
								it is too small for her, <br />
								The true Bride waits for you!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							He looked down at her foot, and saw how the blood was running out
							of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking. Then he
							turned his horse and took the false Bride home again. “This also
							is not the right one,” said he. “Have you no other daughter?”
						</p>

						<p>
							“No,” said the man; “there is only a little stunted kitchen-girl
							which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the
							Bride.”
						</p>

						<p>
							The King’s Son said he was to send her up to him; but the mother
							answered, “Oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show
							herself!”
						</p>

						<p>
							He insisted on it, and Ash-Maiden had to be called. She first
							washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down
							before the King’s Son, who gave her the golden shoe.
						</p>

						<p>
							Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy
							wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a
							glove.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="page-12" class="page">
						<p>
							And when she rose up and the King’s Son looked at her face he
							recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him, and
							cried, “That is the true Bride!”
						</p>

						<p>
							The mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with
							rage. He, however, took Ash-Maiden on his horse and rode away with
							her. As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried:
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>
								“Turn and peep, turn and peep, <br />
								No blood is in the shoe! <br />
								The shoe is not too small for her, <br />
								The true Bride rides with you!”
							</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed
							themselves on Ash-Maiden’s shoulders, one on the right, the other
							on the left, and remained sitting there.
						</p>

						<p>
							When the wedding with the King’s Son had to be celebrated, the two
							false sisters came and wanted to get into favor with Ash-Maiden
							and share her good fortune. When the betrothed couple went to
							church, the elder was at the right side and the younger at the
							left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye of each of them.
							Afterward as they came back, the elder was at the left, and the
							younger at the right, and then the pigeons pecked out the other
							eye of each. And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they
							were punished with blindness as long as they lived.
